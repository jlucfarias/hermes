## Description

Hermes is a simple PWA to create a customized blog/news feed aggregator. The idea was born when [I](https://github.com/jlucfarias) searched for an RSS feed app that can be customized, simple, notify me when a new post of the blogs I follow was published and that has been small. Many alternatives was found but none of these was exactly what I wanted.

The Hermes was not built with podcasts in mind and some bugs can seen when you search for it currently.
